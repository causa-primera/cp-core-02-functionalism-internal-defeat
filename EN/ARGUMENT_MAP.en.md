## Main conclusion (C)
**C:** Strong functionalism about agency is **internally defeated** for responsibility-attribution tasks, because it cannot justify the distinction between **owned commitments** and **instrumental outputs** without importing non-functionalist normative primitives or external governance. ([G1], [G2], [G3], [G5], [G10])

## Premises (numbered; glossary-linked)
**P1.** Responsibility attribution requires distinguishing **instrumental outputs** from **owned commitments** (commitments that can be attributed and answered for). ([G1], [G2])  
**P2.** Owned commitment presupposes a non-delegable ownership step: a responsible locus can withhold, evaluate under reasons, and commit (S→E→K) in an attributable way. ([G2], [G6], [G7])  
**P3.** Strong functionalism identifies agency-relevant states solely with **functional role**. ([G3], [G4])  
**P4.** Purely functional-role descriptions do not, by themselves, generate **normative authority** (why this output counts as *owned* rather than merely produced). ([G5], [G2])  
**P5.** If functionalism treats owned commitment as just a functional profile, it collapses the output/ownership distinction into a behavioral equivalence claim. ([G4], [G2])  
**P6.** To restore ownership, functionalist practice typically invokes **governance layers** (procedures, audits, sign-off roles) and delegation boundaries that are not derivable from functional role alone. ([G8], [G9], [G5])  
**P7.** If normativity/ownership is supplied by governance external to functional role, then functionalism is not providing the grounding it claims; it is importing a normative apparatus. ([G8], [G5])  
**P8.** Therefore, functionalism either (a) presupposes the normative distinction it needs (owned commitment vs output), or (b) externalizes it to governance—both are forms of **internal defeat** for responsibility grounding. ([G10], [G2], [G5])

## Inference steps
**S1.** From P1–P2: responsibility requires owned commitment conditions beyond mere output production. ([G1], [G2], [G6], [G7])  
**S2.** From P3–P5: strong functionalism cannot secure ownership using only functional-role resources. ([G3], [G4], [G2])  
**S3.** From P6–P8: restoring ownership requires importing governance/normativity, hence internal defeat. ([G8], [G5], [G10])  
**S4.** Therefore C.

C: Strong functionalism is internally defeated for grounding responsibility, because ownership requires normative authority not derivable from functional role alone.

P1 Responsibility requires output/commitment distinction.  
P2 Owned commitment requires non-delegable appropriation (S→E→K).  
P3 Strong functionalism: agency = functional role.  
P4 Functional role doesn’t generate normative authority.  
P5 Governance import restores ownership from outside.  
P6 Therefore functionalism presupposes or externalizes normativity → internal defeat.
