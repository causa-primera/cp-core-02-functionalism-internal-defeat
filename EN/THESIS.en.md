# cp-core-02 — Functionalism: Internal Defeat (v0.1.0)

## 1. Claim (core result)
This repository advances a **negative core result**: **strong functionalism about agency** is vulnerable to an **internal defeat** when used to ground **responsibility attribution**.

The internal-defeat thesis is:

> If agency is exhausted by **functional role** (or functional equivalence), then the normative conditions required to distinguish **owned commitments** from mere **instrumental outputs** are either (a) presupposed without grounding, or (b) externalized to governance/procedure—so the functionalist account does not provide the grounding work it claims to provide.

This is not an anti-engineering stance. It is a **normative-structural critique**: functional equivalence may be useful for prediction and design, yet still be insufficient for **ownership**.

## 2. What “internal defeat” means here
A view is *internally defeated* when it must import (from outside its own resources) the very distinctions it needs to perform its explanatory or justificatory role.

Here, the relevant distinction is:

- **Output** (instrumental result) vs
- **Owned commitment** (attributable stance carrying answerability and sanctionability)

If functionalism cannot justify this distinction using only functional-role resources, then it does not ground responsibility “from within.”

## 3. Target: strong functionalism and strong equivalence
This repo targets **strong** versions of functionalism, roughly:

- **Strong functionalism**: agency-relevant states are exhausted by functional role.  
- **Strong functional equivalence**: if two systems are functionally equivalent, they are equivalent in agency-relevant standing.

This is different from ordinary engineering talk (“the system behaves similarly”). The critique addresses **normative standing**, not mere performance.

## 4. Why this matters inside Causa Primera
Causa Primera distinguishes:

- **First Cause (normative)**: a responsibility-bearing locus capable of Suspension→Evaluation→Commitment (S→E→K) as owned acts.  
- **Second Cause (instrumental)**: processes that produce outputs but do not own responsibility.

If functionalism treats “commitment” as a role realized by any system meeting a profile, then:
- signature/commitment becomes a property of pipelines,
- and **Second Cause substitution** becomes structurally easy: outputs are treated as if they were commitments.

So cp-core-02 supports the program’s anti-substitution constraint by showing why “functional profile alone” is unstable as a grounding basis.

## 5. The normative pinch point: ownership is not just behavior
Responsibility attribution requires:
- an attributable locus,
- owned commitment,
- contestability and revision,
- sanctionability (where relevant),
- and boundary legibility (what was decided, by whom, under which criteria).

A system can mimic reason-responsiveness behaviorally while remaining **non-attributable** (no legitimate standing to bear consequences or to retract/affirm as a responsible subject). When governance layers are invoked to supply that standing, the normativity is being imported.

## 6. Relation to other core repos
- **Core-01 (Transcendental Freedom):** supplies the structural requirements for responsible ownership (S→E→K, answerability).  
- **Core-03 (Apparatus Method):** supplies the engineering constraints and interfaces (PoS, decision boundary legibility, challenge channels) that prevent silent substitution in socio-technical systems.

**Core-02 contributes:** a *negative compatibility constraint*—do not treat strong functional equivalence as sufficient for normative ownership without extra normative apparatus.

## 7. Scope limits (v0.1.0)
- This is a scaffold release: core thesis + argument map + glossary.
- It does not settle the metaphysics of mind or consciousness.
- It does not claim that non-human responsible subjects are impossible. It claims that **functional role alone** is not enough to ground responsibility attribution without importing normative structure.
