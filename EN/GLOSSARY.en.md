## G1 — Responsibility attribution
Assigning accountability for a decision/action to a responsible locus under a normative regime.

## G2 — Owned commitment
A stance that can be attributed to a responsible locus as theirs: answerable, contestable, revisable, and (where applicable) sanctionable.

## G3 — Strong functionalism
The view that agency-relevant states are exhausted by functional role (organizational/causal profile), without additional normative primitives.

## G4 — Functional equivalence (strong)
Equivalence claim: if two systems match in functional organization/role, they are equivalent with respect to agency-relevant standing.

**Boundary note:** distinct from practical engineering similarity.

## G5 — Normativity
The “ought-space”: authoritative reasons, obligations, permissions, prohibitions, and justificatory standing.

## G6 — Non-delegable commitment
Constraint that ownership/commitment cannot be delegated to instruments; instruments may propose, but cannot “own” the commitment.

## G7 — S→E→K (Suspension→Evaluation→Commitment)
Minimal structure of strong agency: genuine withholding, criterion-guided evaluation, attributable commitment.

## G8 — Governance layer
Institutional scaffolding (procedures, audits, sign-off, oversight) that supports accountability but is not derivable from functional role alone.

## G9 — Externalization (delegation boundary)
Delegating evaluation/selection to instruments in a way that risks displacing responsibility and confusing outputs with commitments.

## G10 — Internal defeat
A failure mode where a theory must import what it claims to explain or ground using only its own resources.
